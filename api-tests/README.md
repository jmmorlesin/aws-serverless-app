# API Tests

Postman and Newman are used to run the API tests against the API components of the Application.

The assertions bundled with every request ensure that the deployed API returns expected values.

Lambda API documentation available at the [Postman Documenter](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8965684/SzzrYZR2?version=latest) site.
