# AWS Lambda Node Functions

TODO:
* one entry file (index.js)
* multiple handlers exported with "handler" for "hello-node"
* handler for each function
* unit tests in "test" folder
* testable code in "lib" folder
* "npm test" should produce JUnit test results as well as NYC coverage
* if testing and linting all OK then we delete "node_modules", run "npm install --production"
* zip up the "index.js" and "lib" folder as an artifact ready for deployment
